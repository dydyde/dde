- Started the Angular dev server with `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4200` to open the modified application in a browser.
- Captured a full-page screenshot of the current UI from http://127.0.0.1:4200/ for validation.
- Use the forwarded port 4200 to preview the latest logic changes without altering the UI layout.
